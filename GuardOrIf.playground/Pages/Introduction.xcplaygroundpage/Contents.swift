 # Guard or If

 * Created by [Stewart Lynch](https:twitter.com/StewartLynch) â€“ [CreaTECH Solutions](https://www.createchsol.com.com)
 * Last update: 05 05 2022

 This playground is designed to show you the differences between the Guard and If statements and learn how and when to implement one or the other.

 If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@StewartLynch](https:twitter.com/StewartLynch) or email <slynch@createchsol.com>.
